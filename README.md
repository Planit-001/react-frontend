Future steps:
    - use material-ui 'stepper' for 'Suggestions'
    - error messages for api failing in toasts
    - 'lists' page

Ideas:
  - make a 'notes' page (like a bulleten board), where I can leave notes
  - gamify dashboard icon by showing a different https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=dashboard depending on how many todos are made (?)
  - add user settings page
