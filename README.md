Future steps:
    - error messages for api failing in toasts
    - 'lists' page (like todos, but no date)
    - truncate long messages (on todo list item)

Ideas:
  - make a 'notes' page (like a bulleten board), where I can leave notes
  - gamify dashboard icon by showing a different https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=dashboard depending on how many todos are made (?)
  - add user settings page 

Name/brand ideas:
  - 'planner' - something related to 'planning'

Issues:
  <!-- - Todo recent archives isn't showing archives of today -->
